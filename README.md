# Bomb Lab Write-up
In this write-up, I will show you how i solve bomb lab challenge. <br>
First bomb lab is a **Reverse Engineering** challenge, you have to read its assembly to find the message that expected by program. <br>

First we will face the main function:

## Phase_1:

![](/phase_1_out.png)

First, the program prints these strings **"Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You"** and **"which to blow yourself up. Have a nice "**
Then, we will find a calling of **read_line** function which take an input from user, and then mov this input to rdi as an argument to function **phase1**, then calling this function

![](/phase1_internal.png)

In internal code of phase 1 function, we will find that the function copy string **"I am just a renegade hockey mom."** into **rsi** register, and then calling **strings_not_equal** function, function take the user input and the value in **rsi** and if they are the same it will return **0**, and then **test** xor the **eax** if it not equal zero "which means that strings not the same", it will jump to this location **loc_55FBFAC475C4** which will call **explode_bomb** function, and if it equal zero the function will return to main and calling **phase_defused**, and print this string **"Phase 1 defused. How about the next one"**, and here we completed this phase.<br>

## Phase_2:

In this phase, we will find some function initialization firstly and clear the **eax** register, and we will see a calling for function **read_six_number** which tells us how our input format should be.
And then, we will see a comparison between a number and 1, and if this number doesnâ€™t equal 1, then a bomb will be exploded, so we can make sure that our first number is 1.

So, now we will jump to **loc_55901F1135F3** which the program will prepare to loop
![](/pics/prepare_to_loop_p2.png)

Then, we will jump to this location **loc_55901F113612**. <br>
In this location we will see that moving a value in **rbx** to **eax** "we notice that that the value of **rbx** is 1", then we will find that the program adding eax to itself and repeat it. <br>
So if we if we keep tracing this loop with 6 iterations "read_six_numbers", We will figure out that our right sequence should be **1 2 4 8 16 32**, and here we completed this phase. <br>
